JYNNEOS was developed with the support of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ​ (BARDA) as one element of the federal government’s smallpox 
preparedness efforts. Prior to the monkeypox outbreak, the Strategic 
National Stockpile (SNS) held thousands of vials in its inventory, while millions more – either filled and finished or the equivalent in bulk substance – were stored at the manufacturer’s facility in Denmark. ​  On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of an alternative dosing approach that allows health care providers to use the vaccine from one vial of JYNNEOS vaccine to protect up to five people when administered intradermally to individuals 18 years of age or older.  Since the start of the outbreak, ASPR has ordered 5.5 million vials of JYNNEOS from Bavarian Nordic to be filled, finished, and delivered from U.S. government-owned bulk vaccine stored in Denmark, bringing the U.S. government supply to approximately 7 million vials by mid-2023. Under the procurement, Bavarian Nordic agreed to complete a technology transfer that would allow for 2.5 million of those vials to be filled and finished by a U.S.-based contract manufacturer.       Jynneos Vaccine Allocation  HHS is allocating JYNNEOS vaccine to meet the needs of at-risk individuals and prioritize the hardest-hit jurisdictions, which have high case burden and transmission rates for monkeypox.  On August 22, 2022, an additional 360,000 vials of JYNNEOS vaccine were allocated to jurisdictions under phase 4 of the National Monkeypox Vaccine Strategy . Allocations for phase 4 are based on a revised strategy using cases reported (50% weight) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of August 18, 2022, and the estimated size of the underlying population in the jurisdiction that might benefit from expanded vaccination at this point in the outbreak (50% weight). This underlying population currently includes gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, people with HIV or who are eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (HIV PrEP).    Distribution of vials will occur between August 22 and September 30, in three tranches, with each tranche comprised of one-third of the jurisdiction's phase 4 allocation. Jurisdiction may request access to tranches one, two, and three with an attestation to having utilized at least 85% of vials received to date.   JYNNEOS Delivered to Date  Data on JYNNEOS allocation, orders, and deliveries will be made public on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Of note, some vaccine shipments exceed allocations due to distributions made prior to the implementation of HHS’s nationwide vaccine strategy.  The below figures are for vials of JYNNEOS allocated, ordered, and delivered, and reflect amounts made available before and after the FDA issued the emergency use authorization allowing for intradermal vaccination, which allows for up to five doses per vial. As a result, the number of doses available and / or administered will vary depending on when vaccine was received by a jurisdiction and how it was administered to a patient.  All data in the below table reflects vials of JYNNEOS vaccine.
