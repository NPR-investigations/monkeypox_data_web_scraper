JYNNEOS was developed with the support of  the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) as one element of the federal government’s  smallpox preparedness efforts. Prior to the mpox outbreak, the Strategic  National Stockpile (SNS) held thousands of vials  in its inventory, while millions more – either filled and finished or the  equivalent in bulk substance – were stored at the manufacturer’s  facility in Denmark.      On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration authorized the emergency use of an alternative dosing approach  that allows health care providers to use the vaccine from one vial of JYNNEOS  vaccine to protect up to five people when administered intradermally to  individuals 18 years of age or older.  Since the start of the outbreak, ASPR has  ordered 5.5 million vials of JYNNEOS from Bavarian Nordic to be filled,  finished, and delivered from U.S. government-owned bulk vaccine stored in  Denmark, bringing the U.S. government supply to approximately 7 million vials  by mid-2023. Under the procurement, Bavarian Nordic agreed to complete a  technology transfer that  would allow for 2.5 million of those vials to be filled and finished by a  U.S.-based contract manufacturer.  HHS declared  mpox a Public Health Emergency (PHE) on August 4, 2022. The PHE declaration  brought expanded authorities that facilitated a more robust HHS response to the  spreading mpox outbreak. Based on the current trajectory of  the outbreak, the declaration may not be extended beyond the current expiry of January 31, 2023. HHS will continue to monitor the  outbreak and will make JYNNEOS vaccine available to those who may be exposed or  at risk for exposure to mpox.  Thresholds and Replenishment by Jurisdiction  Beginning on January 9, 2023, ASPR will transition to a jurisdictional threshold approach. The threshold calculation is based exclusively on  each jurisdiction’s estimated percentage of the nation’s population for whom  JYNNEOS vaccination is currently recommended. If the calculated threshold for a  given jurisdiction was less than the number of vials that jurisdiction had  available for ordering from HPOP as of December 12, 2022, the threshold was  increased accordingly.  Jurisdictions are already using the  threshold process for oral TPOXX and COVID  therapeutics . Jurisdictions will continue using the Health Partner Ordering Portal (HPOP) to order against their thresholds.  Jurisdictions can order any quantity of vials available to them up  to the threshold. Expanded distribution contracted  by the Strategic National Stockpile allows for rapid fulfilment of additional  vaccine vials to as many sites as needed. To support optimal placement  throughout the jurisdiction, jurisdictions may order a portion of their  available vials (versus ordering the entire available supply) to reach areas of  heightened demand and follow with additional orders to stock or re-stock sites  as needed. Jurisdictions should feel confident to  order only those vials necessary to supply areas of need and continue to  resupply as needed.

The below figures are for total vials of JYNNEOS distributed by jurisdiction, ordered, and delivered, and reflect amounts made available before and after the FDA issued the emergency use authorization allowing for intradermal vaccination, which allows for up to five doses per vial. As a result, the number of doses available and / or administered will vary depending on when vaccine was received by a jurisdiction and how it was administered to a patient.  All data in the below table reflects vials of JYNNEOS vaccine.
