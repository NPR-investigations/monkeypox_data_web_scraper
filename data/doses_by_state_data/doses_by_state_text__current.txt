This approach enables HHS to increase the number of doses that can be made available to jurisdictions and federal entities by up to fivefold. Individuals under 18 years of age subcutaneously.  Learn More    The  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for  Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is making a total of 1.1  milli​​on doses of Bavarian Nordic’s JYNNEOS, an FDA-licensed vaccine  indicated for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox, available for free to  jurisdictions to support their local monkeypox response efforts. The vaccine is  being shipped from ASPR’s Strategic National Stockpile.       Jynneos Vaccine Allocation  The majority of  states and other jurisdictions have ordered the maximum quantity allowed under  the current allocation system.  ASPR and  CDC are working with jurisdictions to right-size allocations and rapidly get  vaccines to the people who need them most.  HHHS is allocating JYNNEOS vaccine to meet the needs of at-risk individuals and prioritize the hardest-hit jurisdictions, which have high case burden and transmission rates for monkeypox. HHS has recently adjusted its formula and is now allocating 25% of vaccine based on case burden and 75% of vaccine for at-risk individuals under Phase 3 of the National Vaccine Strategy. HHS is also reserving a small amount of vaccine for distribution through existing federal channels (HRSA, VA, IHS, etc.)  Using this formula, HHS announced a nationwide allocation of 786,000 doses on July 28.  Jurisdictions were notified of their individual full allocations on Friday, July 29 and ordering began on the same date.  Under the original timeline, doses were to be made available for ordering in three segments beginning on July 29, August 15, and later in August. On August 15, HHS announced that an additional 442,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine were being made available to states and jurisdictions. In light of the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and revised dosing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HHS is able to make both segments two and three available for ordering as of Aug. 15 —double the number of doses as originally anticipated.  As announced on August 18, HHS will open ordering of doses under Phase 4 of the National Vaccine Strategy on Monday, August 22.  Additional information regarding structure of Phase 4, total quantity included and more will be shared with jurisdictions on August 19.​   JYNNEOS Delivered to Date  Data on JYNNEOS orders and deliveries will be made public on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It should be noted that some vaccine shipments exceed allocations due to distributions made prior to​ the implementation of HHS’s nationwide vaccine strategy.  All data in the below table reflects doses of JYNNEOS vaccine.  Data prior to Aug. 15, 2002, reflects a single dose of JYNNEOS as .5mL or one full vial. Beginning on Aug. 15, doses are reflected as .1mL or five doses per vial based on the preferred intradermal route of administration outlined in the Emergency Use Authorization issued by the FDA. ​   JYNNEOS  Doses By Jurisdictions​      Jurisdiction  Total Allocated Doses as of Aug 19 2022, 12pm  Total Requested Doses as of Aug 19 2022, 12pm  Total Shipped Doses as of Aug 19 2022, 12pm     All Jurisdictions   1,082,486   1,070,913   1,061,913    Alabama  5,943  13,383  13,383    Alaska  640  640  640    American Samoa  20  20  20    Arizona  14,453  14,533  14,533    Arkansas  3,160  1,760  1,760    California  109,809  109,909  109,909    California - Los Angeles  72,142  72,122  72,122    Colorado  18,885  18,885  18,885    Connecticut  6,328  6,328  6,328    Delaware  1,895  1,895  1,895    District of Columbia  33,775  33,855  33,855    Federated States of Micronesia  0  -  -    Florida  109,760  109,760  109,760    Georgia  48,042  48,042  48,042    Guam  160  60  60    Hawaii  4,472  4,472  4,472    Idaho  1,900  1,900  1,900    Illinois  20,618  20,618  20,618    Illinois - Chicago  54,029  54,109  54,109    Indiana  12,052  12,052  12,052    Iowa  2,641  2,641  2,641    Kansas  2,276  2,276  2,276    Kentucky  6,380  3,580  3,580    Louisiana  9,362  9,362  9,362    Maine  1,451  1,451  1,451    Mariana Islands  40  40  40    Marshall Islands  0  -  -    Maryland  21,979  21,979  21,979    Massachusetts  26,551  26,551  26,551    Michigan  13,918  12,918  12,918    Minnesota  10,638  8,138  8,038    Mississippi  2,941  2,941  2,941    Missouri  9,413  9,413  9,413    Montana  798  798  798    Nebraska  1,721  1,721  1,721    Nevada  7,322  7,322  7,322    New Hampshire  1,487  1,187  1,187    New Jersey  20,029  20,029  20,029    New Mexico  3,596  3,596  1,996    New York  46,095  28,295  28,295    New York - New York City  125,904  125,904  125,904    North Carolina  18,448  18,448  18,448    North Dakota  575  575  575    Ohio  17,893  17,893  17,893    Oklahoma  5,636  15,236  15,236    Oregon  11,938  11,938  11,938    Palau  0  -  -    Pennsylvania  17,911  17,611  10,311    Pennsylvania - Philadelphia  8,390  8,390  8,390    Puerto Rico  5,107  2,807  2,807    Rhode Island  3,274  3,274  3,274    South Carolina  6,847  6,847  6,847    South Dakota  511  291  291    Tennessee  10,762  10,762  10,762    Texas  57,394  57,394  57,394    Texas - Houston  22,226  22,226  22,226    Tribal Entities  93  -  -    U.S. Virgin Islands  260  260  260    Utah  6,449  6,449  6,449    Vermont  426  426  426    Virginia  22,859  22,859  22,859    Washington  24,530  25,310  25,310    West Virginia  1,957  1,057  1,057    Wisconsin  6,014  6,014  6,014    Wyoming  361  361  361         *  Jurisdictions may also request shipments of ACAM2000 vaccine, which is in much greater supply, but due to significant side effects is not recommended for everyone.​ ​​​  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​            Strategic National Stockpile    About t​he SNS   Stockpile Prod​ucts   Emerge​ncy Pr​eparedness and Response   Training & Exercise Support ​​                     Home    Contact Us    Accessibility    Privacy Policies    Disclaimer    HHS Viewers & Players    HHS Plain Language       HHS, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) 200 Independence Ave., Washington, DC 20201
